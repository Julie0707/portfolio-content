            Main article: Cultural impact of the Beatles
        </h2>
        <p>
            Former Rolling Stone associate editor Robert Greenfield compared the Beatles to Picasso, 
            as "artists who broke through the constraints of their time period to come up with someth
            ing that was unique and original ... in the form of popular music, no one will ever be 
            more revolutionary, more creative and more distinctive ..." The British poet Philip Larkin 
            described their work as "an enchanting and intoxicating hybrid of Negro rock-and-roll with 
            their own adolescent romanticism", and "the first advance in popular music since the War".

            The Beatles' 1964 arrival in the US is credited with initiating the album era; the music 
            historian Joel Whitburn says that LP sales soon "exploded and eventually outpaced the sales 
            and releases of singles" in the music industry. They not only sparked the British Invasion 
            of the US, they became a globally influential phenomenon as well. The Beatles are regarded 
            as British cultural icons, with young adults from abroad naming the band among a group of 
            people whom they most associated with UK culture.

            Their musical innovations and commercial success inspired musicians worldwide. Many artists
            have acknowledged the Beatles' influence and enjoyed chart success with covers of their 
            songs. On radio, their arrival marked the beginning of a new era. They helped to redefine 
            the album as something more than just a few hits padded out with "filler", and they were 
            primary innovators of the modern music video. The Shea Stadium show with which they opened 
            their 1965 North American tour attracted an estimated 55,600 people, then the largest audience 
            in concert history; Spitz describes the event as a "major breakthrough ... a giant step 
            toward reshaping the concert business".

            Emulation of their clothing and especially their hairstyles, which became a mark of rebellion,
            had a global impact on fashion. According to Gould, the Beatles changed the way people listened
            to popular music and experienced its role in their lives. From what began as the Beatlemania 
            fad, the group's popularity grew into what was seen as an embodiment of sociocultural movements 
            of the decade. As icons of the 1960s counterculture, Gould continues, they became a catalyst 
            for bohemianism and activism in various social and political arenas, fuelling movements such as 
            women's liberation, gay liberation and environmentalism. According to Peter Lavezzoli, 
            after the "more popular than Jesus" controversy in 1966, the Beatles felt considerable pressure
            to say the right things and "began a concerted effort to spread a message of wisdom and higher 
            consciousness".

            Established in 2009, Global Beatles Day is an annual holiday on 25 June each year that honours and celebrates the ideals of the Beatles. The date was chosen to commemorate the date the group participated in the BBC programme Our World in 1967, performing "All You Need Is Love" broadcast to an international audience.
